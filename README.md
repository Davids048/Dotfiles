# My Nvim Setup

# How to use this repo?
I have created this repo to keep track of my settings for a portable Neovim editor that can be set up easily in new environments. I have included the neovim configs and additiona config files, such as my Tmux config (.tmux.conf) in this repo. Additionally, there are some guides on this readme file that lists the dependencies required to use this setup. 

## Tmux config 
The tmux config file is located in this folder. To use it directly, you can copy it into the root directory, or create a symbolic link that points the .tmux.conf file in the root directory to the config file in this repo:
```
ln -s ~/.config/nvim/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```
